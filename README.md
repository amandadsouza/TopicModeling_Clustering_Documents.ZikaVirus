Motivation
I decide to use Topic Models because are very useful for the purpose for document clustering, organizing large blocks of textual data, information retrieval from unstructured text and feature selection. That may help on my PHD project on acquiring Knowledge for ontology construction.
The purpose of this project is to test the similarity between official information about Zika virus and information from collaborative networks. So I will try the similarity between the information about diagnostic from World Health Organization (WHO), CDC with a text from Wikipedia.
